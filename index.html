            <h3>Purdue University, January - April 2021</h3>
            <p>For this project, I helped create an event-planning application named Bussin. The app was multi-platform and was built
                using the MERN stack, with a React.js-based frontend and a Node.js/Mongoose.js backend that connected to a MongoDB
                database.
            </p>
            <h4>Tasks:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborated with other developers to create an application to display events near the
                    user and allow them to attend, invite and host events</li>
                <li>Utilized Node.js and Mongoose.js to connect the app to a MongoDB database and
                    service requests for JSON documents</li>
                <li>Designed automated testing cases using JavaScript to ensure proper functionality of
                    backend server functions</li>
            </ul>
