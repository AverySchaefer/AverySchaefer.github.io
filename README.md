Github Pages repo

Hey! This is my github pages repository. This page is used as a portfolio and resume, explaining a few things about me and hopefully looking kinda neat.
Whether or not it does is up for you to decide :)


This page is built using basic HTML and CSS. If you want to take a look at the page, go to AverySchaefer.github.io in your browser and you can see it.
Thanks for checking out my project!
